# novelty-escape
A discovery project into using technology to enhance interactions in University Orientation station games.

## Introduction
This Flask application is built for the Orientation hosted by the University of Toronto Scarborough's Novelty Cantonese Students' Association.
The application served as a station game for the Orientation - the escape room. Players have to solve three challenges using their phone based on this app.

## Controllers
The application has three "controllers", where each controller is accessed with a URL on the phone. Depending on different situations, players have to click the buttonn present on the page in different ways and orders to proceed to the next challenge.
